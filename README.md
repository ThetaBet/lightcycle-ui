# LightCycle UI — Boilerplate

This repository contains a scaffold for the `@lightcycle/ui` library described in `AGENT.md`.

Quick notes:

- Run `npm run build` to produce ESM and UMD bundles in `dist/`.
- After publishing to npm, CDN access via `unpkg`/`jsdelivr` will be available using the UMD bundle.

See `USAGE.md` for examples and `CONTRIBUTING.md` for development notes.
